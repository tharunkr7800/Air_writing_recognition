# Air_writing_recognition
Handwriting analysis is a classic, well-explored problem in the realm of introductory machine learning that encompasses many of
the important topics of neural networks. When we discussed hand writing analysis during coursework, we realized that handwriting
analysis is a project that could be extended with other machine learning concepts for an interesting combination application.

Our project aims to use a combination of computer vision and handwriting recognition to create a system that acts as a virtual
whiteboard. Our model recognizes gestures written in the air and converts it into text. Users would be able to write 
"air words" facing a web-camera either real-time or in-advance and have those gestures translated into letters.
